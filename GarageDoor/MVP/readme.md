# To Use This:
1. Turn on your Raspberry Pi and login
2. Create a new virtual environment ([info here](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/))
3. Activate that virtual environment
4. Copy ```MVPRaspi.py``` and ```requirements.txt``` to your desired folder
5. Run ```pip install -r requirements.txt``` in a terminal at that location
6. Wait for pip to finish installing all the requirements
7. Turn on your computer and login
8. Copy ```MVPArduino.ino``` to your computer
9. Open it in either Arduino Cloud, or the Arduino IDE
10. Verify and Upload to your Arduino
11. Plug in your Arduino and wait for the program to run
12. Go back to your Raspberry Pi
13. Run ```python MVPRaspi.py``` in the open terminal
14. Now it should work
